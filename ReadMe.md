# 👨‍💻 Full Stack Web Developer
Hey there! 👋 I'm a passionate full stack web developer with a focus on building modern, scalable web applications. I specialize in creating fast, dynamic user interfaces using **React** and **Next.js**, paired with **TypeScript** for a robust and type-safe development experience. To ensure that everything looks stunning and responsive, I rely on **TailwindCSS** for my styling needs.

I love solving complex problems and turning them into seamless, user-friendly experiences. Whether it's building APIs, working on server-side rendering (SSR), or crafting beautiful, intuitive UIs, I'm always learning and improving.
